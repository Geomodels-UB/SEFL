# Surface Extraction from LIDAR
SEFL

## Introduction
The aim of this software is to give some process and analysis tools for working with cloud point in a geology environment. We suggest a workflow to detect and isolate geological surfaces in an outcrop. The software is divided in four sections, first section is for create planar regressions, second section to work with the data continuity, third the complementary tools and finally a special module for horizontal works like topographic works with a tool for calculate differences.
Special Module is included for fracture characterization.
